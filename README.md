## Code for CS 6785 Project: Finetuning LLMs for Personal Loan Underwriting

The four notebooks contain code used throughout this project:
 - `preprocessing.ipynb` contains code used for preprocessing the data to use as input into both the LightGBM model training and LLM fine-tuning.
 - `finetuning.ipynb` contains code used for fine-tuning the LLM on Google Colab.
 - `lgbm_training.ipynb` contains code used for training the LightGBM benchmark models, and comparing the LLMs' performance against them.
 - `post_finetuning.ipynb` contains code used for examining the behavior of the fine-tuned LLM.
